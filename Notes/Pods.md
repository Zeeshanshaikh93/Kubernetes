# NOTES: "Kubernetes"

### K8s Crashloopbackoff

* A CrashLoopBackOff is a common error in Kubernetes that indicates a container within a Pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting. This state arises when the container fails to start properly, leading Kubernetes to implement an exponential back-off strategy, where it increases the wait time between restart attempts. This delay starts at 10 seconds and can extend up to five minutes if the container continues to fail.

### Init containers  

* Init containers in Kubernetes are specialized containers that run before the main application containers within a Pod. Their primary purpose is to perform initialization tasks, ensuring that any necessary setup or configuration is completed before the application begins executing.
* Its like depends on statement.

* After writing a yaml file for running any application in K8s,
  * Exposing Pod directly to external world is not a recommended practice, we are using the following only for evaluation.

### Resources in Pods

* Resources refer to the computing power and memory that containers require to function effectively within a cluster
* It limits the memory which requires to run in  the pods
  * CPU
  * RAM  
* It is of are two types
  * requests # lower limits
  * limits # Upper limits

### Replica Sets

* ReplicaSets are a vital component for managing the availability and scaling of applications within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Purpose of Replica sets

* Maintain Desired State: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are running at all times. If any Pod fails or is terminated, the ReplicaSet automatically creates new Pods to replace them, maintaining the desired count.
* Load Balancing: With multiple Pods running, incoming traffic can be distributed among them, preventing any single Pod from becoming overwhelmed.
* Scaling: ReplicaSets allow for easy scaling of applications. You can increase or decrease the number of replicas based on demand using simple commands, enabling dynamic resource management. It enhances the self-healing which monitor the ReplicaSets.
* Integration with Deployments: While you can create ReplicaSets directly, they are often managed through Deployments, which provide additional features like rolling updates and rollback capabilities, making application management more straightforward

### Service

* Kubernetes Services are crucial for ensuring reliable communication, load balancing, and accessibility of applications within a cluster, making them foundational for building scalable and resilient microservices architectures.
* It usually exposes all these
  * ClusterIP: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, allowing communication between Pods.
  * NodePort: Exposes the Service on each Nodeâ€™s IP at a static port, enabling external access.
  * LoadBalancer: Creates an external load balancer in supported cloud environments to distribute traffic to the Service

* Therefore code is present in the my repo, following image shows the Service application has worked successfully,

### Rolling Updates

* Rolling updates are a deployment strategy in Kubernetes that allows for the gradual replacement of Pods running an application with new versions, ensuring continuous availability and minimal downtime.

### Deployments

### Config-Maps

### Secret keys

### Health Checks/Probes

* Kubernetes health checks are essential for maintaining application stability and performance by providing early detection of issues, ensuring only ready instances serve traffic, and optimizing resource management within the cluster.
* There are three types of Probes
  * Liveness Probes: These determine if a container is running. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container.
  * Readiness Probes: These check if a container is ready to handle requests. If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will stop sending traffic to that container until it is ready again.
  * Startup Probes: These are used to check if an application has started successfully, allowing for longer initialization times without affecting the overall health checks.
* It basically, ensures that only healthy instances serve traffic.
