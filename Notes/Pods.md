### K8s "Crashloopbackoff"

* A CrashLoopBackOff is a common error in Kubernetes that indicates a container within a Pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting. This state arises when the container fails to start properly, leading Kubernetes to implement an exponential back-off strategy, where it increases the wait time between restart attempts. This delay starts at 10 seconds and can extend up to five minutes if the container continues to fail.
